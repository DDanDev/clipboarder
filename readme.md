# Clipboarder!!

1- COPY: Select a text or anything you would copy then hold control and hold a numpad number to store a text for that key. Works for anything that can be converted to text when pasted. Files are pasted as their path/filename, etc.

2- PASTE: Hold control and press the same numpad number to paste the text stored for that key!!

Your regular copy paste, windows clipboard history and functionality of the keys while not holding control are unaffected.

Configured to use numpads 1 to 9, while holding control, and wait 200ms of not releasing the numapad key to execute the copy.

You can customize these settings by editing the first few lines of the ahk file in any text editor. 

# Usage

Download and run the .exe standalone or use the open script .ahk file with autohotkey version 2 installed.
