# Clipboarder!!

1- Select a text or anything you would copy then hold control and hold a numpad number to store a text for that key. Works for anything that can be converted to text when pasted. Files are pasted as their path/filename, etc.

2- Hold control and press the same numpad number to paste the text stored for that key!!

Implementation is only for numpads 1 to 9, but the open ahk code has it really easy to add any other key too!!

# Usage
Download and run the .exe standalone or use the open script .ahk file with autohotkey version 2 installed.

# Fixes to come
1- Investigate: pasting TOOOOOOOO MANY times repeatedly very fast (hold control and click the key very fast several times) eventually clears the stored text of that key. The app continues to work though, if this happens, just load content back into that key.
2- Improve: skip trying to paste if key has nothing stored to avoid error popup. For now, just click "continue" in the popup and continue using as normal.
3- Future, maybe: enable pasting stuff other than text too.
