# Clipboarder!!

Hold control and hold a numpad number to store a text for that key.
Hold control and press a numpad number to paste the text stored for that key!!

Implementation is only for numpads 1 to 9, but the open ahk is really easy to add any other key too!!

# Usage
Download and run the .exe standalone or use the open script .ahk file with autohotkey version 2 installed.

# Fixes to come
1- pasting too fast eventually locks down that key

2- forgot to make the keys without control properly trigger the keys not their key names

(super fast fixes, but I gotta leave for today)
